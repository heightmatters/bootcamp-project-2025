        <h2 id="intro">Introduction and Background</h2>
        <p class="intro-p1">
          Value is a pretty important thing. It’s essentially what our world runs on and 
          oftentimes defines the work we do. If the work has no value, what are we even doing?
          Because of this, there is a common want for value and a common desire to produce value. 
          In the midst of all this, it’s easy to get caught in a vicious loop of self-doubt and
          self-deprecation and wonder “am I even doing anything valuable?” And then there is impact. 
          Everyone wants to be “that guy” that makes a huge difference in the world. So what are things
          that help to make an impact?
        </p>
        <p class="intro-p2">
          Just a little bit of background before I get into how I learned to value my work and how I 
          learned to value myself. My name is Noah Chang, and I am a college freshman at California 
          Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo studying computer science. I grew up in a city down 
          in southern California and was basically your average kid. No crazy achievements, no crazy talents,
          just a kid. Honestly, being ordinary is what made me crave this idea of value. I wanted my work to be
          valuable and I wanted to be valuable in general. This motive is what resulted in many issues of 
          self-doubt, low self-esteem, and other self-deprecating natures. So how do we break out of this
          negative cycle that is unfortunately common in many people today? And after that, how do we take 
          the next step towards making choices that positively affect others?
        </p>
        <h2 id="value">Value</h2>
        <p>
          The most complicated yet crucial step of it all is simply to see the value in what you do. 
          It’s simple, but you essentially need to value your work. If you feel like your work is not 
          valuable, everyone else will too. As a person with heavy imposter syndrome, I tend to undervalue
          myself and my work. I’m a huge music guy and I love to compose classical music, but when I was 
          working on my premier (the first playing of a musical piece), there were so many moments of, 
          “does this even sound good?” and “will people even like this?” and getting over these thoughts
          was the biggest hurdle of them all. I wish I had a magic fix to this massive problem, but I 
          really don’t. It’s a gradual process of accruing confidence and reminding yourself why you are 
          doing what you are doing. It’s not easy to get over, but it’s key to valuing yourself and your work. 
          One tip that I do have is to remind yourself of what is your purpose in what you are doing and what 
          you hope to accomplish. Align yourself and set yourself on a track towards a clear goal. This can really 
          help recenter yourself and get you out of that negative spiral.
        </p>
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
        <p>
          Next is the scope. A big thing preventing you from finding value in what you do, is the scope you 
          look through and the scope of your project itself. It’s easy to see all these influential figures 
          and say, “If only I could be just like them”. The reality is, you’re not them, and maybe you never 
          will be, but value is not defined by what some guy on the internet is saying. Value is something that 
          is subjective meaning that what I value is not the same as what someone else will value. Does this mean 
          someone will never appreciate your work? Maybe. But it also means there will be someone out there that 
          will value what you do, and that’s what you need to focus on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next is the scope of your project itself. Don’t try to launch a massive project because you think 
          that finishing a big project is what will boost you to value yourself. In reality, when you launch 
          something that big, the work you do will never measure up to what you want and will only create 
          unnecessary stress. Instead, you should first focus on small projects, small ideas that accomplish 
          what you want. In that way, as you complete each step, you can achieve your goals one step at a time. 
          When I first started my compositions, I didn’t start with a symphony or even a complete wind-band 
          piece (a piece written for an ensemble with only wind instruments). Rather I started with a humble 
          trio. A piano, flute and piccolo. It’s small and nothing compared to what I premiered, but it was 
          where I was able to grow comfortable in a world that I knew nothing about. If you're stepping into 
          a new field or a new project for the first time, it’s easy to get overwhelmed so start small and 
          start slow. It’s sort of like baby steps, but the more you do it, the more confidence you will 
          build and the more you will see the value in yourself.
        </p>
        <p>Now we move onto impact.</p>
        <h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
        <p>
          What is making an impact? Some people may say it’s making a ground-breaking discovery or making a speech 
          that changes a ton of people’s lives, and while it’s true that these are things with huge impact, it’s not 
          the only way to have impact. Let’s use a literal example. If I’m a sniper in a war and I just have my scope 
          zoomed all the way out at a massive crowd of people, there’s no way I’m hitting anybody. In a similar way, 
          it’s easy to say, “I want to impact this massive group of people and I’m going to do it right here right now” 
          and while that may work for some people, it’s far more challenging. It’s especially difficult if you are 
          trying to impact someone in a meaningful way. You just don’t get to have that kind of influence when you're 
          working on such a large group of people. If you really want to influence or change someone’s life you 
          should focus on zooming your scope in and targeting a smaller group of people, or even a singular person. 
          Impact can be on any scale, to any size audience. What really matters is that you're positively affecting 
          whoever your audience may be. It could be launching a small-scale organization, creating a school club, or 
          even supporting one of your friends. Regardless to what degree it is, you are positively affecting 
          someone and by doing that, creating impact. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When I was working on my piece, it was obvious that I wasn’t going to impact everyone. Not everyone 
          will find value in what you do. But that doesn’t mean no one will. I realized that when my piece was
          performed, some people didn’t really care for my piece and that’s okay. However, there were some 
          people it greatly affected (someone came up to me and mentioned that they almost cried during my piece). 
          It’s not about the “missed” impact or change, but about the change you did create. I could beat myself up 
          all night about why I couldn’t affect one person’s life but instead I choose to focus on the people I did 
          influence. 
        </p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Tying it All Together</h2>
        <p>
          So how does this all tie together? Well when you really think about it, in order to have an impact on 
          other people, in order to present something that can change the people around you, you first have to 
          see the value in what you do yourself. By seeing the value in the work you do the ultimate goal is 
          that you’ll see how it reflects on you. You need to see the value in yourself before you’ll have any 
          sort of chance at influencing others. So before you or I can even make an impact, we first need to 
          develop self-esteem and self-confidence to accept that there is purpose, meaning and value to what we 
          do. Then from here on you take that newly acquired confidence and focus it not in a massive crowd or 
          in a large organization, but the people around you. Start small and work up from there. Focus on 
          positively affecting those around you, even if it’s just one person at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, when you think about value and impact, it’s easy to get caught up in the grand ideas of 
          mass-recognition and huge social influence but that’s not really the reality of it all. Finding value 
          and making an impact is something that everyone should and can do.  It starts small and sometimes 
          will stay small and that’s okay. It’s not about influencing a mass of people immediately, rather it’s 
          about uplifting, encouraging, and changing those around you, one at a time.
